## The division algorithm

Polynomial division inverts polynomial multiplication](../multiplying-polynomials/) up to a remainder. Let $P(x)$ and $D(x)$ be polynomials in $\mathbb{R}[x]$ with $D(x)\neq 0$. The dividend $P(x)$ has a unique quotient $Q(x)$ and remainder $R(x)$ in $\mathbb{R}[x]$ such that:

$$
P(x) = Q(x) \cdot D(x) + R(x)
$$

$$
\deg R(x) < \deg D(x) \quad \text{or} \quad R(x) = 0
$$

+ $P(x)$ is the dividend.
+ $D(x)$ is the divisor.
+ $Q(x)$ is the quotient.
+ $R(x)$ is the remainder.

If $R(x)=0$, the division is exact and $D(x)$ divides $P(x)$ in $\mathbb{R}[x]$. The same identity holds in every polynomial ring $F[x]$ over a field $F$ and is the polynomial analogue of Euclidean division for integers.

Existence follows by induction on $\deg P$. If $P=0$ or $\deg P<\deg D$, take $Q=0$ and $R=P$. Otherwise, write the leading terms of $P(x)$ and $D(x)$ as $a_nx^n$ and $b_mx^m$, respectively, with $n\geq m$. Since $b_m$ is a nonzero element of a field, define the polynomial $T(x)$ by:

$$
T(x)=\frac{a_n}{b_m}x^{n-m}
$$

The quotient $a_n/b_m$ belongs to the coefficient field. Subtract the corresponding multiple of $D(x)$ and set:

$$
P_1(x)=P(x)-T(x)D(x)
$$

The leading terms cancel, so $P_1=0$ or $\deg P_1<\deg P$. By the inductive hypothesis, $P_1(x)$ has the form $Q_1(x)D(x)+R(x)$, where $R=0$ or $\deg R<\deg D$. Substituting the definition of $P_1$ proves that $P(x)=(Q_1(x)+T(x))D(x)+R(x)$.

For uniqueness, suppose that two representations exist:

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(x) &= Q_1(x) \cdot D(x) + R_1(x) \\
     &= Q_2(x) \cdot D(x) + R_2(x)
\end{aligned}
$$

Subtracting yields $(Q_1(x) - Q_2(x)) \cdot D(x) = R_2(x) - R_1(x)$. If $Q_1 \neq Q_2$, the left-hand side has degree at least $\deg D$, whereas the right-hand side satisfies $\deg(R_2 - R_1) < \deg D$, a contradiction. Therefore $Q_1 = Q_2$, and consequently $R_1 = R_2$.

> A ring is an algebraic structure with two operations, addition and multiplication, that satisfy associativity, distributivity, and the existence of additive inverses. A field is a ring in which every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse. Common examples are $\mathbb{Q}$, $\mathbb{R}$, and $\mathbb{C}$.

- - -
Let $P(x)$ and $D(x)$ be nonzero polynomials such that $\deg P \geq \deg D$. The degrees of the quotient and remainder are as follows:

$$
\deg Q(x) = \deg P(x) - \deg D(x)
$$

$$
\deg R(x) < \deg D(x)
$$

If $\deg P < \deg D$, then the quotient is the zero polynomial and the remainder is $P(x)$.


## Properties of polynomial division

The following properties follow from the uniqueness of the quotient and remainder and from the degree laws for polynomial operations.

For fixed $P(x)$ and nonzero $D(x)$, the pair $(Q(x),R(x))$ is unique and has $P(x)=Q(x)D(x)+R(x)$, with $\deg R<\deg D$ or $R=0$. When $\deg P\geq\deg D$, the quotient has degree:

$$\deg Q(x) = \deg P(x) - \deg D(x)$$

When $\deg P<\deg D$, the quotient is $Q(x)=0$ and the remainder is $R(x)=P(x)$. The degree of the remainder is always strictly less than the degree of the divisor, regardless of the dividend.

Polynomial division is linear in the dividend. Given two polynomials $P_1(x)$ and $P_2(x)$, and constants $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R}$, the division of $\alpha P_1(x) + \beta P_2(x)$ by $D(x)$ yields:

$$
\alpha P_1(x) + \beta P_2(x) = \big(\alpha Q_1(x) + \beta Q_2(x)\big) D(x) + \big(\alpha R_1(x) + \beta R_2(x)\big)
$$

where $Q_i$ and $R_i$ are the quotient and the remainder of dividing $P_i$ by $D$. The linearity reduces the division of a sum of polynomials to the division of each term separately.

The division is invariant under multiplication of the divisor by a nonzero constant. Given $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ with $\lambda \neq 0$, dividing $P(x)$ by $\lambda D(x)$ produces the quotient $Q(x)/\lambda$ and the same remainder $R(x)$. The relation $P(x) = Q(x) D(x) + R(x)$ is therefore unaffected by rescaling the divisor, up to a corresponding rescaling of the quotient.

> The polynomial ring $\mathbb{R}[x]$ is a Euclidean ring. Its Euclidean valuation is the degree, and division has a remainder with $\deg R<\deg D$.


## Polynomial long division

The long division algorithm repeatedly divides the leading term of the current remainder by the leading term of $D(x)$ and subtracts the resulting product. It stops when the remainder has degree less than $\deg D$. The procedure has three steps:

+ Divide the leading term of the current dividend by the leading term of $D(x)$ to determine the next term of $Q(x)$.
+ Multiply this term by $D(x)$ and subtract the result from the current dividend.
+ Repeat these steps until the degree of the remaining expression is strictly less than $\deg D(x)$.

> When the divisor is a linear polynomial of the form $x - c$, the procedure can be carried out more efficiently using the synthetic division method](../synthetic-division/), which reduces the computation to operations on coefficients alone.


## Example 1

Consider the polynomials $P(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - x - 2$ and $D(x) = x - 1$. The method outlined above is applied to compute the quotient and the remainder of $P(x)$ divided by $D(x)$:

$$
P(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - x - 2
$$

$$
D(x) = x - 1
$$

The division table is constructed with terms arranged in descending order of degree:

$$
\begin{array}{rrrr|rr}
+x^3 & +2x^2 & -x & -2 & +x & -1 \\\\\end{array}
$$

Dividing the leading term $x^3$ by $x$ yields $x^2$. Multiplying $x^2$ by $D(x) = x - 1$ and subtracting the result gives:

$$
\begin{array}{rrrr|rr}
+x^3 & +2x^2 & -x & -2 & +x & -1 \\
-x^3 & +x^2 &     &    & x^2 &    \\\text{//} & +3x^2 & -x & -2 & &
\end{array}
$$

Dividing $3x^2$ by $x$ yields $3x$. Multiplying and subtracting as before produces:

$$
\begin{array}{rrrr|rr}
+x^3 & +2x^2 & -x & -2 & +x & -1 \\
-x^3 & +x^2 &     &    & x^2 & +3x \\\text{//} & +3x^2 & -x & -2 & & \\
     & -3x^2 & +3x &    & & \\\text{//} & \text{//} & +2x & -2 & &
\end{array}
$$

Dividing $2x$ by $x$ yields $2$. Multiplying and subtracting completes the process:

$$
\begin{array}{rrrr|rr}
+x^3 & +2x^2 & -x & -2 & +x & -1 \\
-x^3 & +x^2 &     &    & x^2 & +3x+2 \\\text{//} & +3x^2 & -x & -2 & & \\
     & -3x^2 & +3x &    & & \\\text{//} & \text{//} & +2x & -2 & & \\
     &      & -2x & +2 & & \\
     &      & \text{//} & 0 & &
\end{array}
$$

The remainder is zero, so the division is exact. The quotient and the remainder are:

$$
Q(x) = x^2 + 3x + 2 \qquad R(x) = 0
$$

The factorization of $P(x)$ is therefore:

$$
x^3 + 2x^2 - x - 2 = (x^2 + 3x + 2)(x - 1)
$$


## Example 2

The following example illustrates a case where the division is not exact: the remainder $R(x)$ is a nonzero polynomial whose degree is strictly less than $\deg D(x)$. Consider the polynomials:

$$
P(x) = x^3 + x^2 + x + 2
$$

$$
D(x) = x^2 + 1
$$

The division table is constructed with terms arranged in descending order of degree:

$$
\begin{array}{rrrr|rr}
+x^3 & +x^2 & +x & +2 & +x^2 & +1 \\\\\end{array}
$$

Dividing $x^3$ by $x^2$ yields $x$. Multiplying $x$ by $D(x)$ and subtracting the result produces:

$$
\begin{array}{rrrr|rr}
+x^3 & +x^2 & +x & +2 & +x^2 & +1 \\
-x^3 &      & -x &    & +x   &    \\\text{//} & +x^2 & \text{//} & +2 & &
\end{array}
$$

Dividing $x^2$ by $x^2$ yields $1$. Multiplying and subtracting gives:

$$
\begin{array}{rrrr|rr}
+x^3 & +x^2 & +x & +2 & +x^2 & +1 \\
-x^3 &      & -x &    & +x   & +1 \\\text{//} & +x^2 & \text{//} & +2 & & \\
     & -x^2 &           & -1 & & \\
     & \text{//} &      & +1 & &
\end{array}
$$

The degree of the remainder $1$ is $0$, which is strictly less than $\deg D(x) = 2$, so the algorithm terminates. The quotient and the remainder are:

$$
Q(x) = x + 1 \qquad R(x) = 1
$$

The division can therefore be written as:

$$
x^3 + x^2 + x + 2 = (x + 1)(x^2 + 1) + 1
$$


## The remainder theorem and the factor theorem

The division algorithm leads to a result that connects polynomial division with the evaluation of a polynomial at a specific point. The remainder theorem expresses $P(c)$ as the remainder of dividing $P(x)$ by the linear polynomial $x - c$. Let $P(x) \in \mathbb{R}[x]$ and $c \in \mathbb{R}$. When $P(x)$ is divided by $x - c$, the remainder equals $P(c)$.

Applying the division algorithm with divisor $D(x) = x - c$, and observing that $\deg D = 1$, the remainder $R(x)$ must satisfy $\deg R < 1$, so that $R(x)$ is a constant, denoted $r$. The division algorithm yields:

$$
P(x) = Q(x)(x - c) + r
$$

Substituting $x = c$ into both sides gives:

$$
P(c) = Q(c)(c - c) + r = 0 + r = r
$$

The identity $r = P(c)$ establishes the result.

> The remainder theorem is a direct evaluation method. The remainder after division by $x-c$ is $P(c)$.

- - -
The factor theorem is a direct consequence of the remainder theorem. Let $P(x) \in \mathbb{R}[x]$ and $c \in \mathbb{R}$. The polynomial $x - c$ divides $P(x)$ in $\mathbb{R}[x]$ if and only if $P(c) = 0$.

The proof follows directly from the remainder theorem. Dividing $P(x)$ by $x - c$ gives $P(x) = Q(x)(x - c) + r$, where $r = P(c)$. The polynomial $x - c$ divides $P(x)$ if and only if $r = 0$, which is equivalent to $P(c) = 0.$

The factor theorem establishes a correspondence between the roots of a polynomial and its linear factors: $c$ is a root of $P(x)$ if and only if $x - c$ is a factor of $P(x)$ in $\mathbb{R}[x]$.

> The factor theorem is the link between roots and linear factors used in the unique factorization theorem for polynomials](../unique-factorization-of-polynomials/).


## Example 3

As an application of the remainder theorem, consider the polynomial:

$$
P(x) = 2x^3 - 3x^2 + x - 5
$$

and the value $c = 2$. According to the theorem, dividing $P(x)$ by $x - 2$ yields a remainder equal to $P(2)$. Computing $P(2)$ directly by substitution gives:

$$
P(2) = 2(2)^3 - 3(2)^2 + (2) - 5 = 16 - 12 + 2 - 5 = 1
$$

The remainder theorem predicts that the remainder of dividing $P(x)$ by $x - 2$ is $1$. The result can be verified using the long division method:

$$
\begin{array}{rrrr|rr}
+2x^3 & -3x^2 & +x & -5 & +x & -2 \\\\\end{array}
$$

Dividing the leading term $2x^3$ by $x$ yields $2x^2$, which is the initial term of the quotient. Multiplying $2x^2$ by $D(x)=x-2$ and subtracting the result from the dividend gives:

$$
\begin{array}{rrrr|rr}
+2x^3 & -3x^2 & +x & -5 & +x & -2 \\
-2x^3 & +4x^2 &    &    & 2x^2 &    \\\text{//} & +x^2 & +x & -5 & &
\end{array}
$$

Dividing $x^2$ by $x$ yields $x$. Multiplying and subtracting gives:

$$
\begin{array}{rrrr|rr}
+2x^3 & -3x^2 & +x & -5 & +x & -2 \\
-2x^3 & +4x^2 &    &    & 2x^2 & +x \\\text{//} & +x^2 & +x & -5 & & \\
      & -x^2 & +2x &    & & \\\text{//} & \text{//} & +3x & -5 & &
\end{array}
$$

Dividing $3x$ by $x$ yields $3$. Multiplying and subtracting:

$$
\begin{array}{rrrr|rr}
+2x^3 & -3x^2 & +x & -5 & +x & -2 \\
-2x^3 & +4x^2 &    &    & 2x^2 & +x+3 \\\text{//} & +x^2 & +x & -5 & & \\
      & -x^2 & +2x &    & & \\\text{//} & \text{//} & +3x & -5 & & \\
      &      & -3x & +6 & & \\
      &      & \text{//} & +1 & &
\end{array}
$$

The remainder is $1$, confirming that $R = P(2) = 1$ in accordance with the remainder theorem. The quotient and the remainder are:

$$
Q(x) = 2x^2 + x + 3 \qquad R = 1
$$

The division can therefore be written as:

$$
2x^3 - 3x^2 + x - 5 = (2x^2 + x + 3)(x - 2) + 1
$$


## Rational functions and polynomial division

The quotient of two polynomials is a rational function](../rational-functions/) when $D(x)\neq 0$:

$$
F(x) = \frac{P(x)}{D(x)}
$$

Polynomial division decomposes $F(x)$ into a polynomial part and a proper rational part. A rational function is proper when the numerator has degree less than the denominator:

$$
\frac{P(x)}{D(x)} = Q(x) + \frac{R(x)}{D(x)}
$$

The decomposition is unique: the polynomial part $Q(x)$ and the proper rational part $R(x)/D(x)$ are uniquely determined by $P(x)$ and $D(x)$, as a direct consequence of the uniqueness of the division algorithm.

Partial fraction decomposition](../partial-fraction-decomposition/) starts from this identity and writes the proper rational part as a sum of simpler fractions. These fractions have standard antiderivatives.


## Polynomial division and the GCD

The Euclidean algorithm computes the greatest common divisor through successive polynomial divisions, as in the integer case. For $P(x),D(x)\in\mathbb{R}[x]$ with $D(x)\neq 0$, a greatest common divisor is a polynomial of highest degree that divides both $P(x)$ and $D(x)$. Each division has the form:

$$
P(x) = Q(x) D(x) + R(x)
$$

The common divisors of $P(x)$ and $D(x)$ coincide with the common divisors of $D(x)$ and $R(x)$. Indeed, a polynomial that divides both $P(x)$ and $D(x)$ also divides $R(x)=P(x)-Q(x)D(x)$. Conversely, a polynomial that divides $D(x)$ and $R(x)$ divides $P(x)=Q(x)D(x)+R(x)$. The two pairs therefore have exactly the same common divisors.

The identity $\gcd(P, D)=\gcd(D, R)$ reduces the original problem to polynomials of strictly smaller degree. Iterating the construction produces the following sequence of remainders:

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(x)     &= Q_1(x) D(x) + R_1(x) \\
D(x)     &= Q_2(x) R_1(x) + R_2(x) \\
R_1(x)   &= Q_3(x) R_2(x) + R_3(x) \\
         &\vdots
\end{aligned}
$$

The sequence terminates when a remainder $R_n(x)=0$ is reached. The last nonzero remainder $R_{n-1}(x)$ is the greatest common divisor of $P(x)$ and $D(x)$, determined up to multiplication by a nonzero constant. Its quotient by its leading coefficient is the unique monic GCD.

The Euclidean algorithm is a constructive test for common factors and coprimality, and it also simplifies rational expressions. Two polynomials $P(x)$ and $D(x)$ are coprime in $\mathbb{R}[x]$ when $\gcd(P,D)$ is a nonzero constant.

Every remainder in the Euclidean algorithm is a linear combination of the two initial polynomials with polynomial coefficients. Bézout's identity follows by back-substitution. For the monic GCD $G(x)$, polynomials $A(x)$ and $B(x)$ satisfy:

$$
A(x)P(x)+B(x)D(x)=G(x)
$$

For example, take $P(x)=x^3-2x+1$ and $D(x)=x^2-1$. The successive divisions reduce to:

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(x) &= xD(x)+(1-x) \\
D(x) &= -(x+1)(1-x)
\end{aligned}
$$

The last nonzero remainder is $1-x$, whose monic associate is $x-1$. The first identity is equivalent to the Bézout relation:

$$
x-1=-P(x)+xD(x)
$$

Thus $G(x)=x-1$, with coefficients $A(x)=-1$ and $B(x)=x$. Bézout's identity is also the step that proves Euclid's lemma in the unique factorization theorem for polynomials](../unique-factorization-of-polynomials/).
