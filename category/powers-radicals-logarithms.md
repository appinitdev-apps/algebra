## Introduction to the chapter

For a real number $a$ and a positive integer $n,$ the power $a^n$ is the product of $n$ factors equal to $a:$

$$a^n = \underbrace{a \cdot a \cdot a \cdots a}_{n \text{ times}}$$

The number $a$ is the base, and $n$ is the exponent. The relation $a^n = b$ leads to three questions, each corresponding to a topic of this chapter. Powers determine $b$ from the base and the exponent. Radicals determine the possible values of the base from the exponent and the result. Logarithms determine the exponent from the base and the result.

Repeated multiplication defines $a^n$ only for positive integer exponents. For $a \neq 0,$ the zero power is $a^0 = 1.$ For $a \neq 0$ and every positive integer $n,$ a negative exponent is the reciprocal of the corresponding positive power:

$$a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^n}$$

The equation $x^n = a,$ with $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $n \ge 2,$ asks for a base whose $n$-th power equals $a.$ When $a \ge 0,$ the principal $n$-th root $\sqrt[n]{a}$ is the unique non-negative real number with this property. The parity of the index determines which radicands are admissible. For even $n,$ the equation has no real solutions when $a < 0,$ has the single solution $x = 0$ when $a = 0,$ and has the two solutions $\sqrt[n]{a}$ and $-\sqrt[n]{a}$ when $a > 0.$ For odd $n,$ every real number $a$ has exactly one real $n$-th root.

For $a > 0,$ $m \in \mathbb{Z},$ and a positive integer $n,$ a power with rational exponent $m/n$ can be written in radical notation as follows:

$$a^{\frac{m}{n}} = \sqrt[n]{a^m}$$

The preceding radical identity does not cover $2^{\sqrt{2}},$ since $\sqrt{2}$ cannot be written as $m/n$ with $m \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $n$ a positive integer. For $a > 0$ and $x \in \mathbb{R},$ the definition of a real power in terms of the exponential function](../../exponential-function/) and the natural logarithm is:

$$a^x = e^{x \ln a}$$

The condition $a > 0$ is required because $\ln a$ has no real value when $a \le 0.$ For rational exponents, this definition agrees with the radical one.

In the third question, the base and the result are known, while the exponent is unknown. For $a, b > 0$ with $a \neq 1,$ the logarithm of $b$ to the base $a$ is the exponent to which $a$ must be raised to obtain $b:$

$$\log_a b = c \iff a^c = b$$

The base must differ from $1$ because $1^x = 1$ for every real $x,$ so the corresponding exponential function is constant and has no inverse function](../../inverse-function/).

The exponent rules give the corresponding logarithmic identities. For $a > 0$ with $a \neq 1,$ $x, y > 0,$ and $n \in \mathbb{R},$ these identities are:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\log_a(xy) &= \log_a x+\log_a y \\
\log_a\frac{x}{y} &= \log_a x-\log_a y \\
\log_a(x^n) &= n\log_a x
\end{aligned}
$$

In group-theoretic language, the first identity states that $\log_a$ is a homomorphism from the multiplicative group $(0,+\infty)$ to the additive group $\mathbb{R}.$ Since $\log_a$ is bijective, it is an isomorphism between these groups.

The chapter begins with powers, where the exponent rules are established for integer exponents and then extended to real ones. The properties of radicals and logarithms are derived from these rules.
